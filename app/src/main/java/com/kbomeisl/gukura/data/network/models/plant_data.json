  "summary": "Light intensity strongly influences appearance of African violets and is very important in production of quality plants. Listing a specific light level for African violets is difficult because of variation between cultivars, but a range of 1000 to 1200 ft-c is satisfactory for most cultivars. Cultivars that produce dark green leaves with long petioles may require higher light levels, especially if few flowers are produced, while plants with light green foliage may require lower levels.\n\nGood overall growth can be obtained with a fertilizer regime that provides a 3-1-2 ratio of N-P2O5-K2O at a level that provides about 1200 lbs N/A/yr, 2 lbs N/1000 square ft-month or 3 lbs/yard or 4 grams/6\" pot 19-6-12 every 3 months. Both liquid and slow-release fertilizer sources are acceptable provided the proper rate is supplied during the growing period. Micro-nutrients should be added to the potting medium during preparation or included with the fertilizer program.\n\nAfrican violets are well suited to production in artificial potting media composed primarily of peat moss mixed with vermiculite, pine bark, perlite or styrofoam beads. Care must be taken, however, to be sure plants receive sufficient water, since drying out will suppress growth and flowering. Soil pH should be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 and soluble salts levels below 500 ppm at initiation of growth. The best way to irrigate African violets is by use of capillary mats, since this keeps foliage dry and prevents leaf spotting. Use of a perforated black overlay product is recommended to obtain desirable leaf shape. Plants grow and flower best at high relative humidity. Suggested air temperatures for growing African violets are between 70 and 85Â°F. Lower temperatures reduce growth rate as do temperatures above 85Â°F. Care must be exercised in selecting cultivars to grow in Florida, since some are heat sensitive and will not produce marketable plants in summer, even if maximum temperatures of 85Â°F or below are maintained. Atmospheric mercury did not affect blooming of violets.",

Good growth occurs when soil temperatures are 70 to 85Â°F, with similar air temperatures. Limited growth will occur at 65Â°F soil temperature, but any lower temperature will result in poor or no growth.

"summary": "\"Best growth and flowering of anthuriums depend on many factors of which potting medium, fertilizer and light levels may be considered the most important. Due to their epiphytic nature anthuriums require well-aerated soil mixes, however, the mixes need to provide sufficient moisture as well as support for the plant. Mixes successfully used in Hawaii include wood shavings, tree fern chips, macadamia nut shells, volcanic cinder, taro peel and sugarcane bagasse. Other media that have provided good anthurium growth include mixtures such as 1:1:1 peat:perlite:bark or 1:1 peat:perlite. A medium of 2:1 peat:perlite has also been suggested as good for anthurium.\\n\\nA light level of 1500 to 2000 ft-candles has been proposed as best for anthurium under Florida conditions. Anthurium `Lady Jane' liners from tissue culture grew better at 1200 ft-c than at 2400 or 3600. Best growth and flowering of Anthurium `Southern Blush' in 6-inch pots was obtained with a maximum light intensity of 2000 ft-c compared to 1000 ft-c. Studies in Hawaii with cutflower cultivars showed that flower peduncles were longer and spathe size was increased at lower light levels, while flower production was increased slightly with an increase in light.\\n\\nThe proper fertilizer level necessary to produce anthurium depends upon production light levels. Fertilizer requirements of Osmocote 19-6-12 was 7-13 gm for good quality 6-inch pots of A. scherzeranum at light levels of 3500 ft-c compared to 1-9 gm at 1000 ft-c. A level of 5 gm Osmocote 14-14-14 per 6-inch pot was suggested for anthurium grown at 1500-2000 ft-c.\\n\\n\"",

"summary": "Arecas are propagated from seed with approximately 50 seeds to an ounce. Viable seeds, soaked for 10 minutes in a solution of hot sulfuric acid, can be expected to germinate in about 6 weeks. Fresh seed, yellow to ripe, should be planted with the top of the seed barely visible and germination temperature maintained between 80 and 85Â°F. Lower temperatures will increase germination time 100-200%. Seed storage at low humidity and low temperature is detrimental to germination. Cleaning seed is not essential if they are planted immediately. If seeds are to be stored, clean the yellow to fully ripened red seeds, air-dry them at 80-90%, treat with a seed protectant, and store at 75Â°F.\n\nBest production light level for Areca palms is 5,000 to 6,000 foot-candles, or about 50% shade. Plants should receive a fertilization regime of 3.5 lb nitrogen per 1,000 ft2 a month from a 3-1- 2 ratio fertilizer. A level teaspoon of Osmocote 19-6-12 fertilizer (about 5 g) applied to a 6 inch pot every 3 months, or 200 ppm nitrogen from a 9-3-6 fertilizer applied weekly will supply the required fertilizer. Arecas respond equally well to liquid or slow release fertilizers when nitrogen levels are equivalent. Arecas need supplemental micronutrients to prevent chlorosis. Incorporating micronutrients (1.5 lb Micromax/yd3) to the soil is preferable to foliar sprays which can cause phytotoxicity. Phosphorus should be supplied only from fertilizers such as the 19-6-12 or 9-3-6 mentioned earlier.\n\nGood quality Areca palms contain 1.5-2.5% dry weight of nitrogen, 0.1-0.3% phosphorus, 0.7-2.0% potassium, 1.0-1.5% calcium, 0.3-0.6% magnesium, 10-60 parts per million (ppm) copper, 50-300 ppm manganese and iron and 25-200 ppm zinc. Plants are tolerant of both atmospheric fluoride (F) and F in the medium if pH is maintained above 6.0. Tissue F levels of 16 ppm were found in leaves with no necrosis, while leaves with necrosis had only 21 ppm. Areca palms appear to be more tolerant to ethylene than most foliage plants.\n\nThe pH of the potting medium should be maintained near 6.0 with the addition of dolomite to keep fluoride unavailable to the plant. Mixes that have produced good quality palms include commercial mixes and peat:sand (3:1 by volume) and peat:pine bark:sand (6:3:1 by volume).\n\nAreca palms can tolerate low soil moisture, but best growth is obtained if plants are not subjected to drought conditions. Arecas are hardier than most foliage plants and tolerate short durations of 32Â°F, but some necrosis might occur. Long durations of 32Â°F or lower will severely damage or kill the plants. For best growth, roots should be kept at 70-80Â°F with air temperatures up to 95Â°F. Plants can be shipped satisfactorily for 2 weeks at 55-65Â°F.\n\nIf spray or water residue causes the Areca to be unattractive, plant shines are a possible method of removal. Nine plant shines were used on Chamaedorea elegans with satisfactory results. Additionally, a 5% oxalic acid solution followed by rinsing cleansed Chamaedorea seifrizii of mineral salts.",

"summary": "Nephthytis traditionally has been propagated by seed or leafless, single-node stem cuttings, depending upon the cultivar. Most of the highly variegated cultivars must be propagated vegetatively to retain the characteristics typical of each. Recently, many growers have adopted the use of tissue-cultured plants established as plugs. Since the plug plants are usually multi-branched and in vigorous condition as received by the finished plant grower, production time is minimized.\n\nThe potting medium should have good aeration and water-holding capacity. Syngonium will tolerate a moisture deficit in the soil, but will grow more vigorously if soil is not allowed to dry. Most growers are successfully using one of the commercially available, preformulated, light weight peat-based potting blends. Most of the greenhouse blends have good physical and chemical properties and are available in bags or in bulk.\n\nSuggested light levels for potted plant production are 1500-3000 foot-candles which can be obtained with 70 to 80 percent light reduction during Florida summers.\n\nExcellent growth can be obtained with 3-1-2 (N-P2O5-K2O) ratio of liquid or slow-release fertilizers when applied at the rate of 2.9 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet per month. If irrigation is adjusted to near zero leaching at each irrigation the fertilization rate can be decreased. Conversely, if water use on the crop is excessive, additional fertilizer will be required to maintain proper color and vigor. The latter practice is discouraged. Lower fertilizer rates can also be used in winter with lower light levels and night temperatures which can be dropped to 60Â°F. Slightly higher rates may be needed during the summer months when temperatures and light levels are higher.\n\nIrrigation procedure is important with this crop because of the ease when certain bacterial pathogens are spread with overhead-applied water splashing off the foliage of infected plants. Drip irrigation works well for hanging baskets and large, widely-spaced containers. Hanging plants should not be placed directly over benches of nephthytis because water leaking from the hanging materials can also spread the bacterial blight. If feasible, one of the sub-irrigation systems should be employed for small, closely-spaced plants. The sub-irrigation systems avoid wetting the foliage and provide an opportunity to recirculate the unused irrigation water. Use of solid cover structures (greenhouses) is recommended for this crop.\n\nAlthough nephthytis will survive temperatures near freezing, they grow best between 70 and 95Â°F. Night temperatures can be dropped to 60Â°F without loss of quality or significantly adding to the production time of established plants. Plants being propagated from seed, leafless cuttings or micro-cuttings from tissue culture do benefit from bottom heat of approximately 70Â°F in the root zone.\n\n",

"summary": "Although making controlled crosses and producing plants from the resulting seed is the primary means of obtaining new hybrids, most foliage begonias are propagated from leaf or leaf-chip cuttings. Whole leaf cuttings involve removing most of the petiole and lightly pressing the leaf blade at approximately a 45 degree angle into a clean peat-lite medium contained in either a community flat or a cavity tray. After the base of the leaf cutting roots, a number of small plantlets form from tissue next to the leaf veins.\n\nA number of the foliage begonias will also form roots and plantlets on the leaf blade if cuts are made through the large veins over the leaf blade (lamina) and the point of each cut is kept in contact with the rooting medium. As clumps of plantlets grow from leaf cuttings they can serve starter plants for finished product or some of the plantlets can be separated and grown further to be used as transplants. A few of the plant tissue culture labs have grown foliage begonias successfully through the plug stage, but most have abandoned the crop because it can be propagated relatively easily and more economically through use of leaf cuttings. The cane type begonia are also easily propagated from stem cuttings (terminal stem cuttings, single node cuttings, and multiple node cuttings).\n\nAs with many other foliage plant crops, a few firms have emerged as propagation specialists, rooting the leaf cuttings and selling established plugs to plant finishers. Because the propagation process requires a high level of sanitation and greenhouse management, many growers prefer to start with plugs and concentrate their efforts on finishing high quality potted begonias.\n\nMost of the foliage begonias grow well under temperatures of 62 to 85Â°F, actually the middle to lower end of the range is reported to be best. The light intensity for production should range between 2000 and 2500 foot-candles. Slightly brighter light levels will result in somewhat more compact plants but the intensity of foliage color patterns in some cultivars will be \"washed out\". Plants should always be forced in greenhouses as opposed to shadehouses because the greenhouse environment permits better control of water falling on the plants. Plants maintained with wet foliage usually acquire bacterial leafspot, a very serious disease discussed thoroughly later in this publication.\n\nProper plant spacing through all stages of plant production is crucial to production of healthy plants. Crowding causes longer petioles, more open plants and frequently results in development of bacterial leaf spot. Wider spacing permits the plants to dry off quickly after irrigation, especially if the greenhouse is well ventilated.\n\nGrowers are encouraged to use drip irrigation or some form of sub-irrigation on potted plants to prevent bacterial leaf spot, a disease which has seriously limited the production and utilization of Rex begonias until recent years. Avoid use of overhead irrigation systems if possible.\n\nFoliage begonias have fine textured root systems, a condition which makes them vulnerable to mechanical damage during the potting process if liners are handled carelessly or potting medium is compressed excessively. Care should also be taken to set liners in the finishing containers so the plant crown is approximately the same level as it was in the liner container. Plants set too deep frequently fail due to poor root zone aeration and subsequent root rots. Plants set too high can succumb from lack of water.\n\nBegonias grow well in many of the commercially prepared peat-based potting mixtures which have good aeration and water holding properties. Growers should use the cleanest mixes they can obtain for begonia production. Plants grow well with fertilization from a 3-1-2 or 2-1-2 ratio complete fertilizer with a minor element supplement at the rate of 2.3 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1000 square feet per month. Precautions should be taken to avoid accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone which will damage the fibrous roots.\n\nCrop schedules for foliage begonias are dependent upon cultivar, initial plug size, pot size, number of plugs per pot, temperature, light intensity and other environmental factors. Growers use different planting densities. In general, one plug is used per 4- and 5-inch pots. Two plugs per 6-inch and 3 plugs per 8- and 10-inch pot or hanging basket.",

"summary": "Although very attractive plants, calatheas are frequently omitted from lists of popular foliage plants. Good quality calatheas can be produced but careful attention must be given to the production environment.\n\nCalatheas should be grown with 1000-2000 ft-c. Lower light levels can cause pale leaves with indistinct markings, while higher light levels result in tip necrosis and sometimes bleached areas on the leaf. Three pounds of nitrogen per 1000 square feet a month should maintain good growth and color. With cool temperatures the rate should be reduced, but frequent irrigations might necessitate an increase of fertilizer. Inadequate rates result in loss of color and may cause spotting. A ratio of 3-1-2 (N-P2O5-K2O) should be used. High potassium can cause leaf spotting and reduce color intensity. The nitrogen source should be at least 50% urea or ammoniacal with higher percentages preferable. Good quality calatheas have been grown when the electrical conductivity of the leachate from the soil medium was 1,000 mhos/cm. Micronutrients, 1/2 pounds/yd3 of MicroMax or equivalent, will improve plant color and quality. Tissue analysis revealed that good quality calatheas contained about 3% N, 0.5% P, 3% K, 0.5% Mg and 0.1% Ca. Micronutrients were Cu, 6 ppm, Fe, 130 ppm, Mn, 500 ppm and Zn, 40 ppm. A medium with high water holding and cation exchange capacities, such as a peat:sand mix (3:1 by volume) provides a good base for calathea growth. Calatheas are damaged by fluoride and the pH should be maintained near 6.5. Seven pounds of dolomite per cubic yard can be added to maintain the proper pH in most potting media. Large plants are more susceptible to high summer temperatures. When plants are small, they are tolerant of 100Â°F maximum, but when large, temperatures above 90Â°F will reduce quality.\n\nCalatheas are produced by divisions or tip cuttings, with nodes to form the roots.

"summary": "Nurserymen presently propagate ti plants by three methods: seed germination, rooting of cuttings, including cane, and finishing micro-cuttings or plugs (TC-4) from tissue culture laboratories.\n\nTi plant seed is usually available from seedsmen from late summer through early winter. Seed from a few selections of ti will germinate rather true to type and is sold by seedsmen accordingly. Seed are sown in ground beds, raised beds or in trays on benches. They are covered with about 1/4-inch of peat or peat-lite mix which is kept moist until germination and development when the seedlings are large enough to be easily transplanted to small pots, usually about 2 to 4 inches high. There is no reason why seeded flats cannot be placed in chambers for germination, thus utilizing production space more efficiently.\n\nMany of the highly colored named cultivars are propagated by terminal stem cuttings (tips) which are directly stuck in the pots, then eventually sold. Larger plants are stepped up to larger sizes and grown on. Terminal cuttings usually require intermittent mist applications until sufficient roots are present to prevent necrosis of leaf tips and lower leaf loss.\n\nLike several of the dracaena and yucca species, ti plant can also be propagated from cane pieces (large leafless stem cuttings) ranging from a few inches to much larger. Some retail garden outlets offer short sections of ti plant cane packaged in plastic film with instructions for rooting by the consumer on display racks.\n\nTissue-cultured plantlets of a few ti plant cultivars are offered occasionally by specialists. Since growth of these plantlets is slow and ti plant is a minor foliage plant crop, the interest in using this means of propagation is limited. Most nurserymen feel that it is more feasible to start with large tip cuttings when propagating named cultivars.\n\nLight levels can affect appearance of multi-colored ti cultivars. Cultivars like Baby Doll which normally have dark red leaves with a narrow medium red to pink margin, will begin to produce leaves with wider pink margins as the production light intensity is reduced. Suggested level is about 3000 to 3500 ft-c, which will produce plants with good coloration. Good growth can be obtained with either liquid or slow-release fertilizers at the rate of 2.9 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1000 square feet per month from a 3-1-2 or similar ratio product. Where plants are subject to heavy rainfall or frequent irrigations, the fertilizer level may need to be increased. The potting medium utilized for ti plant should be of good quality, and provide excellent aeration and water-holding capacity. Amendments should include a low to moderate level of micronutrients such as 1 lb Micromax/yd3 and sufficient dolomite to adjust medium pH to 5.5 to 6.5. The higher pH has been shown to be beneficial in reducing fluoride toxicity. Suggested air temperatures for best growth are 65Â°F minimum to 95Â°F maximum. Ti can tolerate lower and higher temperatures, but growth rate will be reduced.\n\n",

The lower rate is applicable to lowest light levels and the higher rate to highest light levels. Potting media used for crotons should have good aeration, but not have excessive drainage since crotons wilt rapidly if allowed to dry. Crotons tolerate 40 to 100Â°F without chilling or heat damage for short periods, but best growth and quality occur between 65 and 90Â°F.\n\n",

"summary": "Potting media used for growing dracaenas should be free from pests, well drained and moisture retentive. Small plants grow well in a mix composed predominately of organic components. Larger plants growing in shadehouses should have a heavier mix, often composed of 10 to 20% sand, to prevent wind toppling. The potting medium should be adjusted to a pH range of 6.0 to 6.5 prior to sticking or potting plants. Elevating pH levels above 7.0 has been shown to cause iron deficiencies. Media should be amended to include a moderate level of micronutrients such as 1 lb of Micromax/yd3. Avoid use of micronutrient blends which contain excessive boron and superphosphate which contains fluoride. Fluoride (F), not an essential element, can induce leaf chlorosis of dracaenas. It is found in some irrigation water, soil mix ingredients and fertilizers, especially superphosphate. Keeping the Ph above 6.0 will usually prevent F toxicity.\n\nTo maintain growth through cool periods, temperature in the production structure should be held above 65Â°F. Suggested air temperatures for best growth range between 65 and 90Â°F. For maximum production, root zone temperature should be between 75 and 80Â°F. If air temperatures exceed 90Â°F chlorosis of `Janet Craig' and notching of `Warneckii' will occur. The chlorosis appears to be iron deficiency, but additions of iron will not prevent the chlorosis. At soil or air temperatures less than 65Â°F, very little growth will occur. Plants will be damaged at 35Â°F air temperature if exposed for short periods, 1-2 days, or if exposed to 55Â°F for 1 week. To simply protect the plants from cold damage, a minimum of 50Â°F should be held and plants should be sheltered from wind. Temperatures below 50Â°F, but above freezing, have been observed to cause chilling damage when plants are exposed to wind.\n\nLight levels can strongly affect appearance of dracaenas, especially the variegated cultivars. Suggested shade level for `Marginata' and `Massangeana' is 63 to 73% (about 3000 to 4000 ft-c), which produce `Massangeana' with good contrast between the yellow and green portions of leaves. Best production light level for `Warneckii' and `Janet Craig' and the small dracaenas is 2000-3500 ft-c, or about 70-80% shade. High light will decrease area of the white stripe on `Warneckii' and Sanderana and increase leaf necrosis.\n\nIn many instances, the small sized dracaenas, usually 6-inch diameter pots and less, are grown in greenhouses along with a mixture of other plants which grow best at light intensities in the 2000 to 3000 foot candle range. Under such conditions, the plants will be somewhat less vigorous and the leaves will be more pendulous. Plants grown above 4000 ft-c probably will not survive well when placed indoors as plants grown at lower light levels.\n\n`Massangeana', `Warneckii' and `Janet Craig' should receive a fertilization regime of 7 g nitrogen per square foot monthly from a 3-1-2 (N-P2O5-K2O) ratio fertilizer or the equivalent of 7 grams of a 19-6-12 fertilizer applied at three month intervals to a 6\" pot. Marginata should receive slightly more fertilizer, about 10 g per square foot monthly. Other dracaenas should receive about 8 g nitrogen monthly or 5 g of a 19-6-12 per 6\" pot every 3 months. During periods of heavy rainfall, the monthly fertilization rates should be increased to compensate for excessive leaching.",

"summary": "English ivy is an excellent foliage plant for hanging planters and other applications which require a cascading or trailing plant. It is also used effectively in dish gardens and other combination planters. In large interior plantings, English ivy makes a good ground cover and cover in free-standing planters containing interior trees. The plant can also be trained into formal shapes on trellises or made into topiary figures. Depending upon a particular application, some cultivars are much superior to others.\n\nEnglish ivy should be rooted and grown in a well-drained, peat-based potting medium with high water holding capacity. Calcium and magnesium is normally supplied by dolomite blended with the potting medium at the rate of 4 to 10 pounds per cubic yard to adjust the pH to approximately 6.0. The amount of dolomite used will depend upon the initial acidity of the medium. Micronutrients can be premixed with the potting medium or added as part of a liquid fertilizer program. Most growers now use commercially prepared peatlite potting mixes which have been blended with amendments to provide proper physical and chemical properties.\n\nA fertilizer with approximately 3-1-2 or 2-1-2 ratio should be used at the rate of 2.5 to 3.0 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1000 square feet per month. If 20-20-20 fertilizer is used, it should be applied at the rate of 14.4 pounds/1000 square feet/month.\n\nIvy grows well at light intensities of 1500 to 2500 foot candles and a temperature range of 65 to 85Â°F. When temperatures rise above 90Â°F root and grow poorly. Use of greenhouses is strongly recommended for the production of high quality plants that require careful manipulation of irrigation, nutrition, light intensity and temperature.",

"summary": "Wax plant is propagated from cuttings which are harvested from stock vines. Normally single-node cuttings are made with a cut approximately 1/4 inch above each pair of leaves, leaving a longer stem section below the leaves to anchor cuttings which are usually direct stuck. Cuttings root in 3 to 4 weeks and a single shoot usually develops from one of the buds on each cutting approximately 4 to 6 weeks later. Roots form along the stem section below soil level with the greatest number of roots developing at or near the node (point where leaves are attached to the stem). Cuttings should be positioned so the node is at the soil surface to ensure maximum rooting. Avoid sticking cuttings too deep as shoot development will be inhibited or prevented if buds are positioned below the soil surface.\n\nWax plants develop best under light intensities of 1500-2000 foot-candles and temperatures of 68 to 75Â°F. Summer rooting and growth of wax plant can be reduced if temperatures are excessively high due to poor ventilation or inadequate cooling. If greenhouses are run very cool in winter, plants will become dormant. An acceptable production temperature range is 68 to 90Â°F.\n\nAfter cutting material is harvested from stock plants, water management becomes one of the most critical factors in propagation. As long as greenhouse relative humidity is high (75 percent or more), the unrooted cuttings should not be misted frequently. Simply apply enough water overhead to keep the soil surface moist, not soggy. After roots develop to the bottom of the pots, the watering frequency should be reduced to permit the potting medium to become relatively dry before the next irrigation.\n\nMost wax plant growers prefer liquid fertilizer application over incorporated slow release products so the fertility level of the potting medium can be adjusted easily as the crop irrigation frequency is changed. Fertilizers with a 2:1:2 or 3:1:2 ratio with microelements added are a good choice. Apply fertilizer at the rate of 2.9 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1000 square feet per month.\n\nPotting media should contain a high percentage of organic material, such as fibrous peat, to provide good water holding capacity and some coarser particles, such as pine bark, perlite and calcined clay to assure good drainage and aeration. Several of the commercially available preblended soilless mixes are suitable for growth of high quality wax plants.\n\nProduction schedules vary considerably depending upon cultivar, temperature and degree of water management. The flat-leaf, all-green types grow more than twice as fast as plants with variegated, reflexed leaves and short internodes. It takes approximately 5 to 11 months to produce a finished 3-inch pot of wax plant with a 6 to 8-inch long vine from an unrooted, single- node cutting. One or two cuttings are stuck per 3-inch pot and 3 to 4 single-node cuttings stuck per 4-inch pot.",

"summary": "Historically, Boston ferns have been grown from offsets harvested from stolons (runners) of older plants. Most of the early nurserymen of central Florida grew their stock plants in ground beds inside cypress lath-covered shadehouses. As the offsets matured they were pulled from the beds, wrapped bare-root in newspaper and shipped to northern markets where many retail customers would purchase them in that form. Others were shipped to growers who would pot and finish the plants for local sales.\n\nToday most Boston type ferns grown in central Florida are finished potted plants or hanging baskets produced in greenhouses which provide maximum environment control. Stock plants are still frequently maintained in stock beds or in raised benches. Today growers either start with plantlets pulled from stock plants or use liners started in plug trays or small pots. In recent years tissue culture has become a common means of propagating a few cultivars. Variation of cultivar characteristics from tissue-cultured plants of some cultivars and relative ease of finishing plantlets collected from stock plants suppresses the tissue culture option.\n\nBoston ferns have a wide tolerance to changing light levels, but grow well when receiving 1500 to 3000 ft-c, with best quality usually produced near 2000 ft-c. Because of the wide spreading habit of these ferns, growers frequently start hanging baskets pot-to-pot and then hang them at the final spacing for finishing. Suggested fertilizer level is 2.9 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1000 square foot per month from a 3-1-2 or 2-1-2 ratio fertilizer. Most growers prefer the liquid option because it can be manipulated more effectively than the slow-release materials.\n\nPotting media utilized for Boston fern should have high water-holding capacity, good aeration and not dry rapidly. Amendments should include a low to moderate level of micronutrients such as 1 lb MicroMax/yd3 and sufficient dolomite to adjust medium pH to 5.0 to 5.5. Higher pH levels have been shown to slightly reduce growth rate. Suggested air temperature for best growth is 65Â°F minimum and 95Â°F maximum; however, Boston ferns will tolerate slightly lower and higher temperatures without great change in growth habits. Boston fern are fairly tolerant to ethylene.",

"summary": "Propagation of figs in Florida is done by three primary methods (layerage, cuttage and tissue culture); however, seed may be used occasionally with certain species. Air layers are traditionally made on the stock plants of F. elastica cultivars, F. lyrata and those F. benjamina destined to be big trees. Most of the vines, shrubs and some plants to be grown into small trees are propagated by cuttings. During the past several years many growers have begun to use tissue cultured Ficus cultivars, particularly new varieties, as the starting point for production.\n\nThe plugs from tissue culture tend to produce a very full, bushy type plant because there are usually several upright stems per plug, each branching freely from the base. If only 1 or 2 shoots are desired in the finished product, the plugs can be separated (pulled apart) and the smaller divisions can be planted.\n\nMost figs can be grown in full sun, but all finished plants for use indoors should be acclimatized under reduced light intensity. A number of species, particularly the shrub and vine types of figs, are better grown continuously in greenhouses or shadehouses with rather low light intensity (1500 - 3000 foot-candles) . Suggested light levels and fertilizer levels for several Ficus species are displayed in Table 1. Both slow-release and liquid fertilizer sources have been used successfully.The potting medium used will vary depending upon plant size and type. All mixes should have good moisture holding capacity and aeration. Potted trees are frequently grown in a medium with 10 to 20% coarse sand by volume added to reduce frequency of plants tipping in the wind. Measures should be taken to avoid excessive root development into soil beneath containers, otherwise plants will be shocked severely at the time they are moved.\n\nPlant injury usually occurs between 30 to 35Â°F, depending upon plant species, physiological condition of the plant and specific conditions of the cold period - rate of change, duration, wind and humidity.",

Plants are not tolerant of flooded or excessively wet soil conditions.Monstera fertilizer requirements do not appear to be high. After planting, when new growth begins, apply 1/4 lb (113 g) of a complete dry fertilizer mix with 20 to 30% of the nitrogen from organic sources.

However, foliar applications of zinc, manganese, and magnesium are more efficacious for vines growing in highly calcareous with a high pH (7â€“8.5). Micronutrient applications should be made 2 to 3 times per year, generally during the growing season. Iron should be applied in a chelated formulation. For the calcareous, rocky soils and sandy soils with a high pH, use a chelated iron specifically formulated for high-pH soils. For sandy soils with a low pH, use either a chelated iron specifically formulated for low-pH soils or iron sulfate, or similar materials. Iron should be mixed with water and applied as a soil drench under the vine canopy.

"summary": "Araucaria heterophylla (Norfolk Island Pine or Australian Pine) is a southern hemisphere conifer native to the Norfolk Islands and Australia. This tree has been referred to incorrectly as Araucaria excelsa for a number of years. Norfolk Island Pine is one of the few conifers able to adapt to interior environments, and is able to tolerate relatively low light levels. In its native habitat, this tree may reach 200 feet in height and grows in full sun, although seedlings can survive for years in the low light understory. Norfolk Island Pine is salt tolerant and this no doubt relates to its ability to grow along the coast in its native habitat. This tree is commonly available from foliage plant producers, but there is another species (Araucaria bidwillii [Bunya - Bunya Pine]) that is also available in small numbers. Most people consider the Norfolk Island Pine the more attractive of the two species and it is easier to grow.\n\nPropagation of Norfolk Island Pine is by seed which germinates fairly rapidly (10-15 days). Seed should be placed flat on the germination medium without covering and lightly misted or fogged until the tap root emerges and top growth is initiated. At that time, seedlings can be irrigated as needed to keep the medium moist. Suggested light level for propagation is 50% shade (5000-6000 ft-c). Often about 5% albino seedlings will germinate and these will die or can be discarded when potting seedlings.\n\nPotting media used for Norfolk Island Pine must be supportive of trunks and help make up for the limited root systems of these trees. A mixture such as 3:1 peat:sand will help keep trunks straight, yet provide good water and fertilizer retention. Mixes with slightly more aeration should be used for seedling trees, but care must be taken not to transplant them before they start leaning because of weak root systems. Media should be amended to include a moderate level of micronutrients such as 1 to 1 1/2 lbs Micromax/yd3 and sufficient dolomite to adjust medium pH to 5.5 to 6.5. Iron (Fe) deficiency in the growing tips has been observed when pH levels were above 7.0.\n\nNorfolk Island Pine will tolerate a wide temperature range. High temperatures (95Â° to 105Â°F) have been observed to cause noticeable tip damage if accompanied by dry winds and clear skies, whereas low temperatures (30Â° to 32Â°F) can cause growing point abortion. Temperatures below 25Â°F can cause severe freeze damage, especially if accompanied by wind. Suggested production temperatures are 60Â° to 90Â°F for seedlings and liners and 45Â° to 90Â°F for potted trees. Light levels can also have a tremendous effect on growth and appearance. Trees grown in full sun will be compact, have a strong trunk and a light to medium green color, whereas shade grown plants have a more open appearance, a weaker trunk and dark green foliage. Producers usually stake trees in 3 gallon pot sizes and larger because they do not form a strong root system and plants often lean, causing unsightly bending of the growing terminal. Although we recommend production in 4000 to 8000 ft-c (30 to 63% shade), this is generally best for trees grown in 4 to 8 inch pots. Larger trees can be grown in full sun and acclimatized in shade for several weeks before placement indoors, or grown under 30% shade.\n\nFertilization regimes required depend on light intensity utilized. The suggested fertilizer rate for trees grown in 4000 to 8000 ft-c (30 to 63% shade) is 1500 lb N/A/yr from a 3-1-2 ratio fertilizer source: liquid or slow-release (equivalent to approximately 34 lb N, 12 lb P2O5 and 23 lb K2O/1000 ft2/yr. When trees are grown in full sun to 30% shade the fertilizer level should be increased from 25 to 40%; the higher amount is suggested for full sun grown trees. When trees are grown in full sun the symmetry is often better, but color, is often yellowish-green or light-green unless fertilizer level is increased, and even then acclimatization is necessary to obtain desired color.",

"summary": "Growers have two options as they begin production of chamaedorea palms, purchase and germinate seeds or purchase liners from a propagator. Those choosing to use seeds must first be concerned with the viability of purchased seed and then understand how to handle seed after it is received. Most chamaedorea palm seed is still collected from tropical and semi-tropical habitats in the fall and then sold through seedsmen, as quickly as possible, to commercial nurserymen.\n\nSeed cleaning is rarely necessary with chamaedorea seeds which have a rather thin fleshy outer layer. Seeds can be sown in propagation beds (raised or ground level), community trays (flats) or cell trays. The trend is toward production of plugs by sowing several seeds per cell tray cavity and covering them with about 1/4 inch of medium. Seed germination and seedling growth is excellent in variety of the well drained peatlite mixes adjusted to a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0.\n\nAlthough it is desirable have seeds throughout the year so several crops can be staged, seed viability decreases as the storage period increases. Some nurseries hold seed as late as early to mid-spring with viability losses of about 10 percent per month or more per month.\n\nAnother option available to nurserymen is to sow the seed at the time it is received , usually mid-fall, and accelerate germination of a portion of the crop by warming the medium to 90Â°F for several weeks until germination occurs. Every month or two additional lots of the sown seed can be brought in from a holding area where temperatures may be allowed to drop into the low 40's. This strategy will permit production of crops of several stages each year.\n\nSince light is not needed for germination, special chambers or rooms can be built to accommodate closely spaced layers of trays for several weeks at a time. One to two inches between trays is sufficient for circulation of warm air within the chamber. In some cases trays con be stacked one upon the other in a staggered configuration which permits some air movement and heat transfer through the stack. Although germination is never uniform with a seed lot, trays should be removed from dark germination chambers after approximately 25 percent of the viable seeds have sprouted.\n\nProduction of chamaedorea palms often includes several months in full sun to encourage basal shoot production and good stem diameter, but most species develop their best color in shade, except C. cataractarum, which maintains good color even when grown in full sun. Chamaedorea elegans grows best in shaded conditions from the seedling stage to the point of finishing.",

"summary": "The tiny seeds are sown on the medium surface and covered with a fine layer of screened sphagnum moss or sphagnum peat. Seeds germinate best at 75 to 80Â°F and the upper layer of medium must be kept moist and low in soluble salts or the germinating seeds will be killed. Various techniques can be used to stabilize moisture in the germination medium. Fine mist nozzles located above the germination flats, sleeves of translucent polyethylene placed around the flats, or rigid plastic covers designed to fit the over the top of a flat will help maintain a desirable moisture level in the germination medium. Shaded greenhouses or germination rooms illuminated with cool white fluorescent lamps can be used for germination with the latter type facility preferred by some nurserymen because more uniform light and temperature regimes can be achieved. Usually light levels of 300-600 foot candles are sufficient for germination. After seedlings develop about two leaves the light level should be increased to 1500-2500 foot candles to maximize growth and keep plants compact. Plants produced in liner trays which have plugs 1 or more across will transplant with less shock than those grown in community flats or propagation beds and then transplanted to finishing pots. Many plant finishers prefer to purchase seedlings in plug form from propagation specialists and be free of the chore of managing plants through the delicate germination and early development stages.\n\nSelf-heading philodendron are not propagated by conventional cutting propagation procedures because of their short internodes and large stems and leaves. Within the past 12 years, hybrid self-headers which do not produce true-to type seeds have been propagated through tissue culture (TC). This innovation has not only provided a means of mass propagation for a number of useful hybrids, but it has essentially generated a new product line. Most philodendron grown from seeds or conventional cuttings produce few side shoots. Most of the philodendron plants from TC have basal shoots which help produce compact plants, even in small pots. Tissue-cultured philodendron are available as plugs from 3/4 to 1-inch across, and in some cases, as nonestablished microcuttings. The type of propagule used by the plant finisher will depend upon the degree environment control achievable in the production area, the ability of the nursery staff and the availability of desired plant material. The majority of nurseries start with plugs, thus avoiding the tedious job of rooting microcuttings in a potting medium.\n\nFlorida nurserymen finish self-heading philodendron plants in container sizes from 6 to 14 inches in diameter. Most of the plants in 6 to 10-inch pots are sold through retail outlets. A few of the 8 and 10-inch and most of the larger plants are sold to the interiorscape market. A few growers produce a limited quantity of 3 to 5-inch pots of self-headers for the retail trade, usually starting from non-established microcuttings.\n\nPlants should be grown in a well drained potting medium with high water holding capacity. Most nurseries growing plants in greenhouses use pots up to 8-inch diameter filled with high quality, preblended mixes composed of over 50 percent Canadian peat and other clean amendments. Under shadehouse conditions growers frequently utilize potting mixes which include some Florida sedge peat plus some bark and sand. Calcium and magnesium are normally supplied through additions of dolomite blended with the potting medium at the rate of 4 to 10 pounds per cubic yard to adjust the pH to approximately 6.0. The amount of dolomite used will vary depending upon the initial acidity of the mix and the projected impact of the fertilization programs and irrigation water on the mix pH. A microelement blend can be added at the time of mixing or as a post-plant application with a soluble microelement mix. Microelements should also be applied periodically during crop development as part of a liquid fertilizer program. A fertilizer with approximately a 3-1-2 or 2-1-2 ratio should be used at the rate of 2.9 to 3.4 pounds of nitrogen per 1000 square feet per month.\n\nAlthough Philodendron selloum and a few of the species will tolerate full sun exposure in Florida landscapes, they have more attractive foliage when grown under shade levels of 3000 to 5000 foot-candles. Most of the hybrid philodendrons from tissue culture do best under 1500 to 2500 foot-candles. Philodendrons grow rapidly when the atmosphere in the production structure is between 70 and 85Â°F.",

"summary": "Temperature. It is not customary to attempt cold protection of field-grown sansevieria because most fields are not equipped with permanent overhead irrigation systems.\n\nGood growth of sansevieria is observed at temperatures of 70 to 90Ã¸F which can be maintained in most greenhouses. Frequently plants grown in central Florida shadehouses are carried with minimal heating through the winter season. Temperatures in these structures should not be permitted to drop 40 to 45Ã¸F.\n\nResearch has shown that plant nutrition influences the sensitivity of sansevieria to chilling temperatures. Application rates of nitrogen in excess of 50 pounds per acre month markedly increases the level of chilling injury.\n\nLight. Sansevieria receive different light intensities depending upon season and system of culture. Open-field beds in Florida receive full sun which ranges from approximately 8,000 to 14,000 foot-candles at mid-day, depending upon season. Light intensities for finishing acclimatized sansevieria in shadehouses and greenhouses should be between 1000 and 6000 foot-candles. Leaves of plants in heavily shaded areas with only a few hundred foot-candles grow slowly, become elongated, weak, and darker green and without the typical cross-banding pattern.\n\nWater. Most sansevieria beds are irrigated using overhead sprinklers. Approximately 0.75 to 1.5 inches of water is recommended per week for sansevieria stock in open limerock fields depending upon temperature, relative humidity, air movement, and soil type. Less water is required for plants growing under structures, in moisture retentive soils and during cool periods. Growers should reduce watering rates during wet periods to compensate for natural rainfall. Overhead irrigation should be applied early in the day so foliage will dry quickly, thus discouraging development of Fusarium leaf spot.\n\nTube irrigation for potted plants is recommended for pots over 4 inches in greenhouses because it keeps foliage dry, prevents accumulation of water impurities on leaves, and helps prevent Fusarium leaf spot development.\n\nChemical Factors\n\nNutrient Elements and Soil pH. Ten to 12 fertilizer applications per year to stock beds under field conditions or under structures will maintain adequate fertility, plant vigor, and quality. Nitrogen is the most critical element in most nurseries in terms of limiting the rate of plant growth. Stock beds should receive 500 to 750 pounds per acre each of nitrogen (N) and potash (K2O). Phosphorus, expressed as P2O5, should be applied at 300 to 500 pounds per acre per year. The higher rates are most applicable to south Florida due to higher temperatures. Fertilizer rates should be reduced slightly when temperatures below 45Ã¸F are anticipated, or when cold water will be dripping on the plants. Media with compounds with little cation exchange capacity, such as perlite, styrofoam, or sand, should have nitrate nitrogen and potassium levels about 20 percent less than indicated in this table.\n\nPotted greenhouse-grown sansevieria should receive the equivalent of 1.7 pounds of actual nitrogen (N), per 1000 square feet per month from a 3-1-2 or 2-1-2 ratio fertilizer.\n\nSansevieria grow well under a soil pH range of 4.5 to 8.5, although a range of 5.5 to 7.5 is preferred. Stock growing in limerock soils is usually subjected to a pH range of 7.5 to 8.5. The pH of beds prepared in sandy soils amended with peat or potting mixes should be adjusted with dolomitic limestone to a range of 6.0 to 6.8. Dolomitic limestone provides adequate levels of calcium and magnesium.\n\nSoil testing is recommended for nurserymen producing plants in containers of soil mixtures with high proportions of peat, bark, or other components which have a high cation exchange capacity. The total salinity of potting mixes and peat-amended soils of beds or benches should be maintained between 800 and 1500 parts per million (ppm) using the saturated paste soil extraction procedure. Levels exceeding 2500 ppm are excessive enough to reduce plant vigor in some soils. Table 2 shows extractable nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) levels for potted sansevieria soils utilizing the saturated paste extraction procedure followed by the University of Florida Soil Testing Laboratory.",

Higher fertilizer levels will be necessary to produce plants of good quality if higher light levels are provided, but plants will not be acclimatized for interior conditions. Both slow-release and liquid fertilizer sources have been successfully used. Brassaia actinophylla growth or quality was not affected by the ammonium:nitrate ratio, plants grew equally with 100% ammonium as with 100% nitrate, but less Xanthomonas leaf spot was observed when plants were grown with a 50:50 ratio of ammonium:nitrate. In addition, high levels of fertilizer, 8 grams Osmocote 19-6-12 per 4 inch pot greatly reduced Alternaria, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas leaf spots and produced excellent quality plants.\n\nGood quality S. arboricola have been found to contain 2.8-3.7% dry weight N, 0.26-0.35% P, 2.5-3.5% K, 1.5-2.0% Ca and 0.4-1.0% Mg and good quality B. actinophylla contained 2.0-4.5% N, 0.15-0.50% P, 2.0-3.5% K, 0.5-1.8% Ca and 0.3-0.7% Mg. Good quality B. actinophylla was grown in a range of 2.5 to 10.2 mhos/cm when under 70 ft-c and 100-150 mhos x 10-5 when grown under 1200 ft-c.\n\nPotting media used for schefflera must have good aeration, especially if plants are grown where they are subjected to rainfall, since root loss may be extensive during rainy periods when soil oxygen levels are low. Schefflera will tolerate 35 to 105Â°F without chilling or heat damage, but best growth and quality occur between 65 and 90Â°F. Schefflera `Gold Capello' was reported to bring greatest returns when grown at a minimum temperature of 60Â°F as opposed to 64 or 68 in Belgium during the winter. Brassaia actinophylla had less symptoms of Alternaria leaf spot when grown at a minimum night temperature of 75Â°F than at 60 and almost no symptoms when grown continuously at 80Â°F. S. arboricola grew taller and had better color when produced in 85% relative humidity compared to 60% relative humidity. B. actinophylla is very susceptible to ethylene. Both species can be shipped at 50-55Â°F for 4 weeks with slight loss of quality. Growth of S. arboricola was equal when grown indoors under fluorescent or incandescent light at equal intensities.",

"summary": "Holiday cacti grow best in light shade of 65 to 80% (approximately 1500 to 3000 foot-candles) with the\nhigher shade level preferred. Excellent growth can be obtained with 3-1-2 (N-P2O5- K2O) ratio liquid or slow-release fertilizer when applied at a rate of 1200 to 1400 lbs N/A/year (equivalent to 28 to 33 lbs N/1000 ft2/year). Micronutrients should be added. Irrigation is sometimes reduced and fertilization stopped in early September to promote flowering. Potting media utilized must have excellent aeration as Holiday cacti do not grow well in heavy, wet mixes. A pH of soil 5.5 and mhos/cm of 1,000 appears optimum. Good growth occurs when soil temperatures are 70 to 80Â°F, with similar air temperatures. Limited growth will occur at 60Â°F soil temperature, but lower temperatures result in poor or no growth. Lower temperatures of 50Â°F minimum promote flowering.\n",

"summary": "The commonly grown `Vittatum' and `Variegatum' cultivars will grow under a wide range of light intensities, but appearance can be strongly influenced by light levels. Plants grown in 1000 to 2500 ft-c are usually best adapted to interior use and have medium to dark-green leaves with white stripes. Plants grown under higher light intensities often have light to medium-green leaves with white to yellowish stripes and may have increased incidence of necrotic spotting. When light levels are lower than 1000 ft-c, plants often have somewhat drooping leaves without the normal graceful arch. Blooming of plants and subsequent production of \"spiders\" (offsets growing on blooming spikes) is dependent on both light intensity and day length. The largest number of blooming offsets occur on plants receiving light for 12 hours/day or longer at intensities of 1500 to 2500 ft-c. Interrupting the night with 100 watt incandescent light also stimulated stolon formation.\n\nProper fertilization of spider plants is important, but nutrient demand is not as great as many other foliage plants. Excellent quality plants can be produced with a fertilizer program that provides 1500 lb nitrogen/acre/yr from a 3-1-2 ratio fertilizer source (equivalent to approximately 3 lb N, 1 lb P2O5 and 2 lb K2O/1000 ft2-month or 4 grams of 19-6-12 per 6 inch pot-3 months). Fertilizer source selected should not contain fluoride and boron content should be very low. Fluoride damage is much more severe when plants are grown at high light levels and high fertilizer levels, but boron toxicity symptoms were not affected by variations in temperature. Good quality Chlorophytum comosum `Vittatum' have been analyzed and found to contain 1.5 to 2.5% N, 0.10 to 0.20% P, 3.5 to 5.0% K, 1.0 to 2.0% Ca and 0.5 to 1.5% Mg. Micronutrient content ranges were 10-60 ppm Cu, 50-300 ppm Fe, 50-300 ppm Mn and 25 to 300 ppm Zn. Leaves with fluoride toxicity symptoms were found to contain 70 parts per million (ppm) fluoride percent dry weight, while healthy leaves contained only 25 ppm. Leaves with boron toxicity had 82 ppm boron, those with no toxicity contained 35 ppm.\n\nA wide range of potting media are accept for production of spider plant. Best media appear to be those with excellent aeration and high cation exchange and water holding capacities, such as prepared artificial mixes, combinations of peat (at least 50%) and pine bark, vermiculite, perlite and styrofoam beads. Media should be amended if necessary with sufficient dolomite or limestone to raise the pH to a range of 6.0 to 6.5, and micronutrients should be added only if they will not be present in the fertilizer program. Be careful to use components that do not add significant levels of fluoride or boron to the medium. Suggested air temperatures for best growth range between 70 and 90Â°F. Spider plant will tolerate temperatures as low as 35Â°F without damage, but plants will not grow much at temperatures below 65Â°F. Temperatures above 90Â°F will not directly damage spider plants, but will increase transpiration rate and increase uptake of potentially toxic micronutrients.\n\nSpider plant is one of the easier foliage plants to grow because it tolerates wide changes in media, fertilization, light and temperature without serious loss of quality. It is also relatively free of serious disease, insect and mite pests.",

"summary": "Since leaflets of 'ZZ' plants are naturally glossy, no polish is needed. Finished plants are usually placed in paper sleeves and shipped in refrigerated carriers at a temperature between 55Â°F and 65Â°F. Once they arrive at the market, plants should be placed under interior light levels of 25 foot candles or higher. Plants produced in 4- to 6-inch pots can be placed on office desks or table tops, but those in 8- or 10-inch pots are best placed on the floor, even in corners where light levels are low. 'ZZ' can also be used as pseudo bonsai or in a combination planter. The average height of most of the plants is about 16 to 32 inches, and the plant may have a wide spread of 20 to 40 inches. Larger plants will have a 3 to 5 feet overall spread. 'ZZ' works well as an accent plant in areas where it can \"spread its wings.\" Plants should not be fertilized if EC readings are 2.0 dS/m or higher. Media should be kept slightly dry in interior conditions. Temperatures of 68Â°F to 75Â°F are most appropriate. Pot sizes should be increased as the plants grow to provide room for the increased number and size of rhizomes during interiorscapes.",
